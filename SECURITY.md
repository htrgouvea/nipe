# Security Policy

If you find a security issue with Nipe, please DO NOT submit it via the issue tracker! Instead, please follow responsible disclosure practices and send information about security issues directly to [hi@heitorgouvea.me](mailto:hi@heitorgouvea.me) so that a proper assessment can be made and a fix prepared before a wide announcement. You will receive an acknowledgement within 24 hours.

Even in cases where you have limited or incomplete information, or you're not sure whether or not a problem constitutes a security issue, please make contact as soon as possible. We can work together to investigate, debug, and assess.

Your help is greatly appreciated in keeping Nipe secure!
